	<!--  student  -->
	<br> <h2>research</h2> <hr>
	<p>I am a PhD student in Computer Music at the University of California, San Diego. My research is in spatial audio and sonification. Specifically, I work on binaural filter design, and on the sonification of real time parameter streams. Currently, I am supported in part by a UCSD grant for research on sonifying wearable bio-sensors. A sonification toolkit for the Pd and Max will be available for download by the end of the year as a result of this project.</p>

	<br> <h2>professional experience</h2> <hr>
	<p>Professionally, I have worked for Sonic Arts R&D at CalIT2 for two years, where I build audio software solutions for businesses in telecommunications, media, and the arts. Unfortunately, I can't give away the software that I make for work.</p>
	
	<!--	independent projects  -->
	<br> <h2>indie software dev</h2> <hr>
	<p id="bottom">As an independent developer, I write applications and plugins for musicians and sound designers, which emphasize simplicity and ease of use. Some of those projects are available for download <a href="projects.html">here</a>. All of my personal work is open source and uses non-restrictive licenses.</p>
